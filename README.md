# Stock Bot

A python script to check if a item is in stock mainly for amazon but can be adapted to other sites as well.

This is my beginner project and the code might be rough and this is for my school community project.

Due to the sillicon shortage that is expected to last till 2022 and is plaguing graphics card stock, I have decided to make this bot in order to help people get their hands on a graphics card or anything that is affected by the shortage.
