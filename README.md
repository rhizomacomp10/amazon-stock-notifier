This is my beginner project and made in 3 days, the code might be rough and this is for my school community project.

Due to the sillicon shortage that is expected to last till 2022 and is plaguing graphics card stock, I have decided to make this bot in order to help people get their hands on a graphics card or anything that is affected by the shortage.

# Requirements
1. You need to have the newest public version of chrome installed
2. Latest version of [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) in the same directory as main.py (Not needed for linux users)

# Usage
1. Have Python 3.7 or higher installed to path.
1. Open powershell (or cmd) and `CD` to the directory where main.py is located
2. Type in `python setup.py` to install the requirements for script
3. Type in `python main.py` to start the bot
5. Done! The program will automatically refresh the site and check for stock and sending it to your desired discord webhook.
